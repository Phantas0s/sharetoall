                    <h1>Sharing is caring</h1>

                    <p>Imagine that you found a very interesting piece of knowledge on Internet. Naturally you want to share it to a maximum of people.
                    <p>You will need to:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Go to every single social media you have an account on</li>
                            <li>Share</li>
                            <li>Hope that you won't stay on them procrastinating</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>I think the principle of social media is great: sharing to people who follows you. Who trusts you.</p>

                    <p>However, social media are not exempt of problems:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They are engineered to hook you on their website.</li>
                        <li>They will try to sell you a lot of stuff.</li>
                        <li>They are totally addictive.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Sharetoall is an answer to those frustrations. A free and simple platform to share on social media without any hooks.</p>

                    <p>More and more functionalities will be added keeping this goal in mind.</p>

                    <p>What is better than feeling useful?</p>
