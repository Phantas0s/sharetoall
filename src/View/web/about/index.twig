                    <h1>Welcome to Sharetoall!</h1>

                    <p>My name is Matthieu Cneude. I am a web developer and creator of Sharetoall.</p>

                    <p>Imagine that you found a very interesting piece of knowledge on Internet. Naturally you want to share it to a maximum of people.
                    <p>To do so you would need to:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Go to every single social media you have an account on</li>
                            <li>Share the helpful information you found</li>
                            <li>Hope that you won't stay on them procrastinating</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>A bit tedious, isn't it?</p>

                    <p>I think the principle of social media is great: sharing to people valuable and helpful pieces of knowledge.</p>

                    <p>However, social media have some problems:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They are engineered to hook you on their website.</li>
                        <li>They are totally addictive.</li>
                        <li>They will try to sell a maximum via advertisements and other tricks.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Sharetoall is an answer to those frustrations. A free and simple platform to share on social media without any hooks.</p>

                    <p>More and more functionalities will be added keeping these goal in mind.</p>

                    <p>Since I work on this website on my free time, any donation are welcome! It will help add new functionalities.</p>
